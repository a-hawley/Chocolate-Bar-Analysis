# Chocolate-Bar-Analysis
We will import a data set concerning nearly 1,800 chocolate bar ratings, hypothesize, and analyze the data with Jupyter notebooks found in the .IPYNB file.  Our questions will cover possible correlation between farm location/company/cocoa percentage with ratings.  I accomplished this by graphing and reading SQL queries through Pandas dataframe capabilities and Seaborn's visualizations.  To understand this analysis better, I researched the process of chocolate prodiction/manufacturing and the growth of cocao seeds, but it will not be necessary for you as a reader.  I found this data set at https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings and the actual data was derived from http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html.  

***For clarity's sake, these ratings are based off opinion, and have no objective meaning.  If I were to gather 1,800 results from other chocolate connoisseurs, there is a high chance the data would be significantly different.

# Glossary
Cocoa: The leftover powder of cacao seeds that have been ground and pressed.
Cacao beans: the raw pods, beans and ground-up contents of the beans.


# IMPORTS
To run the cells, you will need to import the following:

    * Pandas
    * Numpy
